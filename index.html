      Students of School of the Art Institute of Chicago's Writing for Film, Video, and Performance are pleased to present <i>LIMBO? AN EXPIRATION DATE!</i>, an online streaming event of unique visions that moves and explores on the edge, pushing the boundaries of image making to their invisible borders and reaches beyond. Contemplations of mental health, the beauty and horrors of dreamscapes, constructions of narrative filmmaking, and the cycles of life and death and what lies in-between.

      <h3>Hongjin Chen</h3> <br>Hongjin Chen is a filmmaker from China. She is currently studying at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Majored in film making and directing, and other art fields involved include photography, painting, sculpture, fiber, and art therapy. Most of her works are presented in different ways to reflect various social issues. She believes that every artwork needs to be thought-provoking, not just for making art.<br>
      
      <br><br>
      <h3>Khanh Mai Doan</h3> <br> Khanh Mai Doan was born in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), Vietnam in 2002. Despite not coming from a family with an art tradition, she soon found her interest in drawing at a very young age through reading comics and watching animated films. Throughout her time at AIS, a bilingual school where she studied for 10 years, Khanh was able to nurture her passion upon several art competitions, both in school and around HCMC, earning her an Award of Innovative Idea during 9th grade. Having her focus shift into filmmaking, Khanh decided to further challenge herself with the IB Diploma program at EF Academy New York in the last two years of high school. As a senior, she was nominated for IB Visual Arts HL and IB Psychology SL Student of the Year (with winning the latter one), both of which have greatly contributed to her perspective and skills on her learning journey as a filmmaker. In her free time, she can be found exploring the complexity of humanâ€™s mind and behavior artistically through photography, film editing/reviewing as well as graphic design. Khanh is currently a freshman at School of the Art Institute Chicago pursuing a BFA in Film.
